abstract = "With cloud computing, new services in information technology (IT) emerge from the convergence of business and technology perspectives which furnish users access to IT resources anytime and anywhere using pay-per-use fashion. Therefore, it should supply eminent functioning gain to the user and simultaneously ought to be advantageous for the cloud service provider. To accomplish this goal, many challenges have to be faced, where load balancing is one of them. The optimal selection of a resource for a particular job does not mean that the selected resource persists optimized for the whole execution of the job. The resource overloading/under-loading must be avoided which could be gained by appropriate load balancing mechanisms. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of load balancing techniques and mechanisms, there is not any comprehensive and systematic review about studying and analyzing its important techniques. Hence, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the existing load balancing techniques proposed so far. Detailed classifications have also been included based on different parameters which are relying upon the analysis of the existing techniques. Also, the advantages and disadvantages associated with several load balancing algorithms have been discussed and the important challenges of these algorithms are addressed so that more efficient load balancing techniques can be developed in future."

abstract = "Resources in large-scale distributed systems are distributed among several autonomous domains. These domains collaborate to produce significantly higher processing capacity through load balancing. However, resources in the same domain tend to be cooperative, whereas those in different domains are self-interested. Fairness is the key to collaboration under a self-interested environment. Accordingly, a fairness-aware load balancing algorithm is proposed. The load balancing problem is defined as a game. The Nash equilibrium solution for this problem minimizes the expected response time, while maintaining fairness. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is used to search for the Nash equilibrium. Compared with static approaches, this algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of job arrival and execution, and can adapt dynamically to these processes. The synthesized tests indicate that our algorithm is close to the optimal scheme in terms of overall expected response time under different system utilization, heterogeneity, and system size; it also ensures fairness similar to the proportional scheme. Trace simulation is conducted using the job workload log of the Scalable POWERpallel2 system in the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Our algorithm increases the expected response time by a maximum of 14%. But it improves fairness by 12–27% in contrast to Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Switching Algorithm, and k-Percent Best."

There exists a large number of algorithms to find Wardrop equilibria, both centralized and distributed. This paper presents a distributed control algorithm, which converges to a Wardrop equilibrium, derived from the algorithm presented in Fischer and Vöcking (2009). The innovation lies in the fact that convergence results are obtained considering that communications occur over time-varying communication graphs, with mild assumptions on the graph connectivity in time (uniform connectivity).}

ABSTRACT = {With the dramatic increase of connected devices, the Internet of things (IoT) paradigm has become an important solution in supporting dense scenarios such as smart cities. The concept of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has emerged as a viable solution to improving the capacity of cellular networks in such scenarios. However, achieving optimal load balancing is not trivial due to the complexity and dynamics in HetNets. For this reason, we propose a load balancing scheme based on machine learning techniques that uses both unsupervised and supervised methods, as well as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). As a use case, we apply our scheme to enhance the capabilities of an urban IoT network operating under the LoRaWAN standard. The simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio (PDR) is increased when our scheme is utilized in an unbalanced network and, consequently, the energy cost of data delivery is reduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that better outcomes are attained when some techniques are combined, achieving a PDR improvement of up to about 50% and reducing the energy cost by nearly 20% in a multicell scenario with 5000 devices requesting downlink traffic.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for web applications deployed across multiple data centers results in large electricity costs for service providers and significant impact on the environment. This has motivated service providers to move towards more sustainable data centers powered by renewable or green sources of energy, such as solar or wind. However, efficient utilization of green energy to service web applications is a challenging problem due to intermittency and unpredictability of both application workload and renewable energy availability. One possible solution to reduce cost and increase renewable energy utilization is to exploit the spatio-temporal variations in on-site power and grid power prices by balancing the load among multiple data centers geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a framework for reactive load balancing of web application requests among Geo-distributed sustainable data centers based on the availability of renewable energy sources on each site. A system prototype is developed, its underlying design and algorithms are described, and experiments are conducted with it using real infrastructure (Grid'5000 in France) and workload traces (real traffic to English Wikipedia). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reduce cost and brown energy usage with efficient utilization of green energy and without a priori knowledge of future workload, availability of renewable energy, and grid electricity prices.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a scheduler for a multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP) for bandwidth aggregation in heterogeneous wireless environments. The performance of the MPTCP can be degraded due to the head-of-line (HOL) blocking caused by path heterogeneity, when a buffer size is limited. This performance degradation can be overcome by a careful design of a scheduler, which has a role of allocating each data segment to one of subflows. We derive the theoretical limit of the achievable aggregate throughput and show that the optimality is achieved when the load is balanced between subflows. Based on the analysis, we propose the optimal load balancing (OLB) scheduler that approximately achieves the theoretical throughput limit. By simulations and experiments, we show that the proposed OLB scheduler outperforms the default scheduler of the Linux MPTCP implementation.}

The principles of model predictive control and reinforcement learning are reviewed in a tutorial manner. From model predictive control theory it is inferred that the optimal value function is piecewise quadratic on polyhedra and that the optimal policy is piecewise affine on polyhedra. Various ideas for exploiting the knowledge on the structure and the properties of the optimal value function and the optimal policy in reinforcement learning theory and practice are presented. The ideas can be used for deriving stability and feasibility criteria and for accelerating the learning process which can facilitate reinforcement learning for systems with high order, fast dynamics, and strict safety requirements.}

Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness.}

The approach comes from the Eco-problem solving ideas based on interactions between agents, each of them trying to reach its own satisfaction. It works by displacements within the set of possible states searching for a state satisfying the greatest number of constraints. These displacements are guided by stochastic and heuristic local repairs distributed on each variable. Each variable performs its repairs by using its own simulated annealing process combined with a min-conflicts heuristic; one of the originalities lies in the distributed implementation of the latter process. The approach also focus on the termination, completeness and optimisation problems, which are difficult to be dealt with by distributed approaches.",
